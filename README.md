KeitouOS - is simulator of operating system on Python.

# ATTENTION!!
I've added the Window Maker GUI, so far it's all experimental, and it's
not a fact that it will work correctly I want you to test this desktop 
environment with my operating system. You can also change the code and 
make your own GUI for my operating system.
# UPDATE!! 
I was able to make 
the terminal work normally in the graphical shell, however it still 
needs time to work fully as the real terminal works, so far in the 
graphical shell you will not be able to use clear, or games and a 
browser. Maybe I'll work on it again today.

# Kitkat Update
I've created my own repository, now the package manager downloads 
programs from it .py to the /usr folder, but to use them you need to use 
the ``run``
